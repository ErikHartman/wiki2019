#### Overall
* Deside on overall site structure. Make sure there are not to many tabs in the navbar while still not having to much content on each page. The frontpage should contain a very-short summery of each link. One should be able to read the frontpage and quickly get a sense of the contents of the rest of the site. 
* Refractor so that header and footer are completely separate.

#### UI
* tocbot.js scrolls too far.
* Tocbot jumps when scrolling.
* Fix navbar width.
* Make fonts work on mobile.
* Link to accounts in footer.

#### Pages
* People page.
    * Shoud contain photos and short descirptions of team members and supervisors.
* Home page
    * Give it more color and umph!
